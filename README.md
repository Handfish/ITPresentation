# IT Improvements & Strategic Initiatives Presentation

This is a web-based presentation built to showcase key IT projects and foundational improvements implemented over a seven-year period. It is designed to be viewed in a web browser and can be run locally without any special server setup.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this presentation is to document and communicate the value and impact of five foundational areas of improvement within the IT department. It goes beyond listing completed tasks to explain the strategic thinking behind each initiative, highlighting how they have modernized the department's technology, processes, and overall capabilities.

The presentation serves as a comprehensive summary of work for leadership and management, making a case for the significant, long-term value generated by these projects and the expertise required to execute them.

## Technology Stack

This presentation is intentionally lightweight and self-contained, using standard web technologies:

*   **Reveal.js:** The core presentation framework that handles slide navigation, fragments, and the overall structure.
*   **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** A professional animation library used for the "cinematic scroll" effect on the "Wall of Advocates" slide.
*   **Custom HTML & CSS:** All content and styling are written in plain HTML and CSS. There are no external frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind. All custom styles are located within the `<style>` block in the `<head>` of the `index.html` file.

## How to View the Presentation

Because this is a static HTML project, viewing it is simple.

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository:** Ensure you have all the files (`index.html`, images, videos) in the same directory structure.
2.  **Open in Browser:** The easiest method is to simply double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your default web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).

For the best experience and to avoid potential browser security issues with local files, it is recommended to run a simple local web server. If you have Python installed, you can do this easily:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
cd /path/to/presentation-folder

# Start a simple Python web server (for Python 3)
python -m http.server
```

Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Project Structure

The project is contained within a single HTML file and associated media folders.

```
/presentation-folder
├── index.html            # The main presentation file
├── /img/                 # (Example) Folder containing all .png, .jpg images
│   ├── scraper.png
│   └── ...
├── /video/               # (Example) Folder containing all .mp4 videos
│   ├── embarkout.mp4
│   └── ...
├── /thumbnailsFromMobileApp/ # Folder for the thumbnail gallery images
└── README.md             # This file
```

## How It's Built: Key Architectural Concepts

Understanding the structure is key to editing or adding content.

#### 1. Slides are `<section>` Tags

Each slide in the presentation is defined by a `<section>` tag placed directly inside `<div class="slides">`.

```html
<div class="slides">
    <section>Slide 1 Content</section>
    <section>Slide 2 Content</section>
</div>
```

#### 2. The Overlay Layout Pattern

Most slides use a consistent overlay pattern to place images and videos on top of the text content.

*   `slide-content-wrapper` is the main container for a slide's content.
*   `main-content` holds two key children:
    1.  `text-content`: Contains the three-column `topic-container` that holds the descriptive text. This is the bottom layer.
    2.  `images-container`: An absolutely positioned `div` that "floats" on top of the text. Helper classes like `.single-large-center` or `.grid-2x2` control its size, position, and the layout of the images within it.

#### 3. Sequential Reveals with Fragments

Elements are revealed one by one using Reveal.js's fragment system. Any element with `class="fragment"` will be hidden until the user navigates forward. This is used for revealing bullet points, images, and videos in a specific order.

```html
<!-- This image will only appear on the next step -->
<img src="my-image.png" class="slide-image fragment">
```

#### 4. Video Overlays

Videos are handled by two special CSS classes:
*   `.video-overlay`: Fits the video within the screen, preserving its aspect ratio (good for most videos).
*   `.video-overlay-cover`: Forces the video to cover the entire screen, cropping the edges if necessary (good for cinematic, full-screen effects).
